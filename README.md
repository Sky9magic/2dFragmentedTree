# 2dFragmentedTree
the code for 2d Fragmented Tree where updates and queries are ranged, and query in a form of

$$f_{i=x0}^{x1}( g_{j=y0}^{y1} (A_{i,j}))$$

where f and g is an associative operation, but in my code I'm using f as $\sum$, and g as $min$

I'm kind of bad at explaining this data structure and I've written it in a very informal code, but you can modify the part with comments.
